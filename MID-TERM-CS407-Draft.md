## Assignment 2: Observer into your daily life environmental or societal scenes, and figure out things that were *not-right* under your eyes

- **Real** scenarios/scenes
- Pick one thing and suggest solution to make that thing **more-right**

STATUS QUO: 
- no one talks about burnout
- people scare to admit it --> don't want to be different --> don't want to be seen as not giving their best 
- not many people actually known about their status --> lack of awareness				

# Burnout 

Burnout has been defined as a job-induced syndrome combining emotional exhaustion, depersonalization/cynicism, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment 


the prevalence of burnout cannot be estimated for the basic reason that burnout is not diagnosable (Bianchi, Schonfeld, & Laurent, 2015a;Bianchi, Schonfeld, Vandel, & Laurent, 2017; Doulougeri, Georganta, & Montgomery, 2016)

- emotional exhaustion --> the core of the syndrome

a score at the 70th percentile on exhaustion is relatively high, but it may not be associated with subjective distress, health disorders, or poor performance.

Often taken for granted, the link between work stress and burnout has itself been shown to be open to question

it should be underscored that an individual can feel stressed (out) at work for reasons that are not initially or primarily related to his or her job
(e.g., conjugal or familial problems)


>Hakanen and Bakker (2017) argued that the ignorance of nonwork factors in burnout research has prevented us from determining what kind of ill-being and suffering is assessed by burnout
measures. Interestingly, these authors cited the results of an
interview-based study (published in Finnish), suggesting that individuals with relatively high levels of burnout symptoms typically have problems both at work and at home

>In a recent study carried out in Switzerland and involving 468 health professionals, only 44% of the participants with burnout symptoms considered their job to be the main cause of these symptoms (Bianchi & Brisson, inpress). 

>Taken together, these observations suggest that recommendations for work-centered interventions cannot be straightforwardly derived from data collected with burnout measures. The
problem raised here is of great concern given that the utility of
burnout has been, to a considerable extent, linked to the ability of the construct to specifically capture work-induced ill-being and
suffering


>The question of whether the components of burnout refer to depressive symptoms under nonmedical labels has raised growing concerns in recent years

>Emotional exhaustion, the main component of burnout, is assessed with items such as “I feel fatigued when I get up in the
morning and have to face another day on the job” and “I feel like
I’m at the end of my rope” (Maslach et al., 1996). Such items are
indicative of fatigue/loss of energy, depressed mood, and possibly
sleep disturbance, three diagnostic criteria for major depressive
disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

- People may even refuse the chance to take a break

> Depersonalization/cynicism has sometimes been thought to constitute a clearly distinguishing feature of burnout. However, items such as “I have become less interested in my work since I started this job” or “I don’t really care what happens to some recipients” (Maslach et al., 1996) actually refer to symptoms that are commonly found in depression, namely, loss of emotional involvement, withdrawal, and loss of interest

> Loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable and “not caring anymore” are well-known characteristics of depression


> Depersonalization/cynicism also involves irritability, as illustrated by the MBIGeneral Survey item “I just want to do my job and not be bothered” (Maslach et al., 1996). 

> In depression, irritability often masks sadness, especially in younger and male individuals (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; Martin, Neighbors, & Griffith, 2013)

> Consistent with this finding, men have been repeatedly found to show higher levels of depersonalization/cynicism than women (Maslach et al., 2001).

> Diminished personal accomplishment, the third component of burnout, refers to negative self-evaluation and feelings of failure in
the job. Feelings of worthlessness constitute a diagnostic criterion of major depressive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

> Low self-esteem and the belief that one is unable to deal with the adversity encountered (at work or elsewhere) are hallmarks of depression (Beck & Alford, 2009).

> In effect, unresolvable stress, which is thought to play a causative role in the development of burnout
