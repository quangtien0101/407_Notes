>"What a person thinks on his own, without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people, is even in the best case rather paltry and monotonous"
>---Albert Einstein

**Thinking Outside the Box** often requires linking the ideas in your are of knowledge with those of others who play in different boxes, who are outside your sphere

Innovators go out of their way to meet people with different backgrounds and perspectives to extend their own knowledge. And they are constantly bouncing their ideas off of others to get feedback

> "Ideas typically do not just come to you. They happen because you've been talking about something and talking to a lot of people about it for a long period of time."
> --- Mark Zuckerberg

Innovators are less likely to network for resources or career progression; rather, they actively tap into new ideas and insights by talking with people who have diverse ideas and perspectives

If you want to launch an innovative new venture, networking is a critical skill, not only for generating new ideas but also for mobilizing the resources to launch new ventures

The basic principle of idea networking - as opposed to resource networking - is to build a bridge into a different area of knowledge by interacting with someone with whom you, or people within your primary social networks, typically do not interact 

Omidyar and others like hime make a conscious effort to meet people with different education backgrounds; who hail from different countries, industries, and business functions; and who are of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and so forth.

Innovators intuitively seem to udnerstand that new ideas are often triggered through conversations with individuals who live in a different network of contacts

>People with connections across structural holes [gaps in social networks] have early access to diverse, often contradictory, information and interpretations, which gives them a competitive advantage in seeing and developing good ideas

This is not creativity born of genius; it is creativity as an import-export business. An idea mundane in one group can be a valuable insight in another

Effective idea networkers also plan to find new ideas by regularly tapping outside experts for ideas, by attending networking events, and by building a personal network of creative confidants

>The insights required to solve many of our most
challenging problems come from outside our
industry and scientific field. We must aggressively
and proudly incorporate into our work findings and
advances which were not invented here.

### Tap Outside experts
"Who else has faced or solved a problem like this before?"

"Some problems and new business ideas are such a paradigm shift that talking to people reinforces the current paradigm"

The point is that while getting new ideas and perspectives from experts can lead to innovative ideas, experts are alos indoctrinated with a particular perspective that may be incorrect. So remember to ask counter intuitive questions that challenge the so-called experts. Then listen carefully, with a healthy dose of skepticism

### Attend Idea-Networking Events
TED	conferences
Attending a conference that is designed for the exchanging and debating of ideas from a variety of fields is likely to create a collision of concepts that can turbocharge your associating skill

A conference on a topic outside your direct industry and field of expertise can also spark new ideas.

### Form a personal networking Group
We found that many innovators build small network of people who are their "go to" folks when they want to find or test new ideas

>As a CEO, you find there are few places where you can really publicly talk about fundamental concerns

> As a result, I’ve created an unofficial group. It’s fairly senior,
fairly seasoned people who are comfortable throwing out
ideas and then forgetting about them if these hunches or
speculations aren’t right. One thing about being a CEO is
that you’ve got to be very careful about what you say in
public and whom you involve in these conversations. That’s why networking for ideas, for me at least, is unofficial.”

For this reason, it's important to form a *trusted* network of confidants, since the issues under discussion are of critical and sensitive strategic value

### Networking: How well do you take rejection?

Meeting new people is easier said than done. So what stops you? It may be a lack of confidence that prevents you from reaching out to people you don't known. You might get rejected.

So what can you do to minimize the probability of rejection when making the pitch? Tell the person you want to engage that "I'm interested in your ideas. I'm interested in your perspective." This taps into his or her desire to help or be viewed as an expert.

Once you get the opportunity to exchange ideas with someone, and if you want to keep the door open to future conversations, you have one goal: <span style="color:red"> be interesting </span>

What makes someone interesting?
First, breadth of experience matters in a big way.
>If you’ve traveled widely (China, Australia, Italy), experienced widely (Broadway shows, scuba diving), read widely (novels, history, different subjects), or networked widely (“Yes, I know so and so; we met when . . .”), then you increase your chances of being interesting to someone.

Second, make sure you perfect your elevator speech on the topic you want ideas about.
If you can tell interesting stories about the problem or challenge you are trying to solve, that will spark an interest. Being able to tell short, interesting stories on a variety of topics increases your interesting quotient.
