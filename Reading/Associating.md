**Status quo bias** -  the tendency to prefer an existing state of affairs to alternative ones
> Creativity is just connecting things
> --- Steve Jobs ---

Einstein once called creative thinking "combinatorial play" and saw it as "the essential feature in productive thought"

Associating -- or the ability **to make surprising connections across areas of knowledge, industries, even geographies** -- is an often taken for granted skill among the innovators we studied

> The nature of being successful with software is you always have to be looking for the next thing, so you have to condition your mind to think that way
> ---Mark Benioff---

Benioff's vision emerged from years of significant software-industry experience combined with countless questions, observations, explorations, and conversations that ultimately helped him bring together things that had never been connected before

### What it is

Walt Disney did put ideas together in ways that sparked creative insights throughout the company

Innovative leaders at well-known companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Tesla do exactly the same thing. They cross-pollinate ideas in their own heads and in others'. They connect wildly different ideas, objects, services, technologies, and disciplines to dish up new and unusual innovations

>Sometimes a solution from one industry can apply to a different industry. That can be really powerful.
>---Elon Musk---

This is how innovators think differently, or what we call associating, a cognitive skill at the core of the innovator's DNA

### Where it happens
>Innovative ideas flourish **at the intersection of diverse experience**, whether it be others' or our own.

Throughout history, great ideas have emerged from these crossroads of culture and experience. Put simply, innovators intentionally manuever themselves into the intersection, where diverse experiences flourish and foster the discovery of new insights.

TED's underlying beauty springs form the intentional diversity of participants and presentations. This diversity forms the foundation for innovators to potentially connect the unconnected

### How it works
It is important to understand how the brain works

The brain doesn't store information as a dictionary does, alphabetically with, say, theater under T. Instead, while theater will associate with T, **it will also associate with all of the other knowledge stored in the brain that the brain associates with it**. Some associations with theater will seem logical, such as Broadway, showtime, or intermission, while others may be less obvious, such as kissing, acting career, or anxiety.

The more diverse knowledge the brain possess, the more connections it can make when given fresh inputs of knowledge, and fresh inputs trigger the associations that lead to novel ideas

>"How could I be the Uber of X?"

Applying the peer-to-peer business model (Uber) to other contexts might produce some intriguing new ideas:
- the "Airbnb of storage"

When the brain is actively absorbing new knowledge, it is more likely to trigger connections between ideas (thus creating a wider web of neural connections) as it toils to synthesize novel inputs

Accordingly, the associating "muscle" can also be developed through the active practice of questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting

>Why were all innovators so much better at associating than non-innovators?

> The best predictor of excellent associating skills was how often people engaged in the other discovery skills -- questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting

Disruptive innovators shine the best at associating when actively crossing all kinds of borders and engaging the other innovator's-DNA skills.

Finding the right question, making compelling observations, talking with diverse people, and experimenting with the world usually delivers productive, relevant associational insights.

### On the Hunt for New Associations
#### Creating odd combinations
The friction between opposite lifestyles often resulted in the most unexpected (and often creative) outcomes. Similarly, innovators often try to put together seemingly mismatched ideas to compose surprisingly successful combinations.

>"What if we combined this with that?" 
>"... this, this, and this with that "

they think differently by fearlessly uniting uncommon combinations of ideas

Sometimes the world's most innovative leaders capture what seem like fleeting associations among ideas and knowledge, mixing and matching quite different concepts. In doing so, they produce the occasional outlandish idea that may be a catalyst for innovative business ideas

> Not everyone would consider putting “fresh produce” and “post office” together, but that’s the kind of thinking that increases the probability of surfacing an innovative business idea.

#### Zooming in and zooming out
Innovative entrepreneurs often exhibit the capacity to do 2 things at once: they dive deep into the details to understand the nuances of a particular customer experience, and they fly high to see how the details fit into the bigger picture.
Synthesizing these 2 views often results in surprising associations.

>You have to think laterally. You know,
seeing and combining certain things going on at the
same time and understanding how seemingly unrelated
things could have something to do with each other. You
need the ability to grasp different things going on at the
same time and then to bring them together. For example,
I can look at the bigger picture and also have a very good
feel for the details. So I can go between high-level things
to really, really small details. The movement often makes
for new associations.

Steve Jobs mastered zooming and out to create excellent and often industry-changing products

Jobs was equally adept at zooming out to detect unexpected intersections across diverse industries. Job's Pixar experience provided the broad cross-industry perspective that fueled the invention of several game-changing ideas, such as iTunes, iPod, iPad, and iPhone

#### Lego thinking
if innovators have one thing in common, it is that they love to collect ideas, like kids love to collect Legos. 

> the best way to get a good idea is to get a lot of ideas

Yet absolute quantity of ideas does not always translate into highly distruptive ideas

> You cannot look in a new direction by looking harder in the same direction
> ---Edward de Bono, author of Lateral Thinking---

Getting lots of ideas from lots of different sources creates the best of all innovation worlds

Innovators develop experience at understanding, storing, adn recategorizing all this new knowledge. This is important because the innovators we studied rarely invented something entirely new. More often, they simply recombined the ideas they had collected, in new ways, allowing them to offer something new to the market

The more building blocks they acquired, the better they were able to combine newly acquired knowledge to generate a novel idea

### A safe place for new thoughts
Sometime an association or idea sparked at the very moment they were engaed in questioning, observing, networking, or experimenting

Equally often, innovators uncover new ideas **while in a relaxed state, without distractions**, when they are not "trying" to solve a problem ("de-focusing their attention"). **It rarely happens during a meeting** when they are in a focused, convergent thinking mode searching for a solution to a particular problem

> the "shower" is a great place to relax and think to get new ideas - a place frequently pitched by many innovators
> Innovators also unearth new ideas while walking or driving, while on vacation or in the middle of the night

> "You get more creativity by giving yourself the space for ideas to simmer. Ideas come from having a longer time horizon about what you're thinking about and a broader view of where the idea might be going to go"

The point is that you can sometimes spend too much time deliberately attacking a problem, when in fact some creative ideas will emerge only after you put yourself in a relaxed state with no distractions

If all else fails when trying to figure out a problem, go to sleep. Harvard researchers have found that sleep is a consistent antidote to tunnel vision toward a problem

Look for places of transition or relaxation. Some folks find their best ideas early in the morning; others late at night. Whatever works best for you, make sure that you make the time to just mediate and think.

>When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something . . . they were able to
connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things.
> --- Steve Jobs---

### Tips for Developing associating skills

#### Tip #1: Force new associations
They might imagine (or force) the combination of features in, say, a microwave oven and a dishwasher

To practice forced associations, first consider a problem or challenge you or your company is facing. Then try the following exercises to force an association that you normally wouldn't make:

> Pick up a product catalog and turn to the twenty-seventh page. What does the first product that you see have to do with the problem you are thinking about? Does the way it solves a problem for a customer have anything to do with your problem?
> ...
> Or, open a completely random Wikipedia entry by choosing a random article from the Wikipedia web menu.

Now, back to the challenge you or your company is facing. Try one of these forced-association exercises, identify an unrelated random item or idea, and take the time to reflect on what it has to do with your problem

The point is to randomly find things to associate with your problem and work your best to freely (even wildly) make associations, lots of them

#### Tip #2: take on the persona of a different company
Write down a list of companies (in related and unrelated industries) on a stack of index cards. USe the card stacks to create random pairings of your comapny with another. Then creatively brainstorm ideas on how the 2 could create new value through partnership or merger. By combining the strengths of both companies, you may surprise yourself with new products, services, or process ideas.

#### Tip #3: generate metaphors and analogies
Each analogy holds the potential for seeing things from an uncommon perspective.
What if watching TV were more like reading magazine
What if your product or service could incorporate the benefits of some of today's hottest products, like Amazon Alexa or virtual reality headset?

apply an analogy from a situation you know well to a new context
Where could you be the "Uber of X"?

#### Tip #4: Build your own curiosity box
Start a collection of odd, interesting things (e.g., a slinky, model airplane, robot, and so on)

Then, you can pull out unique items randomly when confronted with a problem or opportunity

When brainstorming for new ideas, because odd, unusual things often trigger new associations. It may sound silly but seemingly silly things can provoke the most random associations, literally forcing us out of our habitual thinking patterns

#### Tip #5: SCAMPER!
SCAMPER:
- substitute
- combine
- adapt
- magnify, minimize, modify
- put to other uses
- eliminate
- reverse
- rearrange

Use any or all of the concepts to rethink the problem or opportunity you are addressing
