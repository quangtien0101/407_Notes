>"I havent' failed ... I've just found 10,000 ways that will not work" - Thomas Edison

The world is the business innovators's laboratory. And beyond just creating prototype, they try out new experiences and take apart products and processes in search of new data that may spark an innovative new idea.

Experimenting is the best suited for generating data on what might work in the future, In other words, it's the best way to answer our "what if" questions as we search for new solutions. Often, the only way to get the necessary data to move forward is to run the experiment.

>"Experiments are key to innovation because they rarely turn out as you expect, and you learn so much"

If you can increase the number of experiments you try from a hundred to a thousand, you dramatically increase the number of innovations you produce
