# Assignment 3:Your solution for the status quo in assignment 2

In the assignment 2, I've presented the burnout syndrome, which essentially the state of a combination of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment. I then made some extra observations from interviewing ten peoples whom are my colleagues, close friends relatives. With some additional analysis based on their answers, I concluded a 3 status-quo on mental health issues in general which is:
- People don't talk about burnout or mental health issue in general
- People scare to admit their state, partly because their low self-esteem
- The lack of awareness cause not many people actually know about their status

With that in mind, I would need to come up with a technology-based solution to tackle these status-quo. In my previous assignment, I layout some simple solution such as integrating the mental health research/study into our education system. The reasons for such a solution is that if we can teach children and teenagers about their physical health and body, why not at least putting the same effort on mental health therefore they are prepared to cope with things such as burnout syndrome more easily. But with a much closer research on why no one would have done that already, I discovered that to construct comprehensive courses/classes for children and teenagers on this issue would require to be based on a solid foundation of knowledge on mental illness. But even for today, the lack of data (due to not that much people actually look for professional help), basic definitions on some mental illness syndrome such as *burnout* are still in hot debate by researchers, all of these things certainly do not help much when it comes to designing courses/classes.

In my last assignment, I also mentioned the "better option" path 
- A better option for people with low self-esteem to deal with the adversity encountered at work rather than have cost their own health issue to prove it.
- A better option that people can easily reach to talk about their states and get professional help. So easy that they won't have to think twice to do it  

This gave me some initial idea which is more practical than the "re-vamping" the education system solution. One of the reasons why people don't look for a professional help is partly due to the fact that they don't want to go through all the inconveniences like looking up all the information about the professionals, scheduling, ... And the fact that people with low-self esteem would actually be discouraged to look for help from the first place, let alone that they stumble such a inconveniences would make things worse. If there is a better option, which just lies in the palm of their hand, and with just less than 3 taps away from getting professional help, would that be incredible for them? But a mobile application just for quickly connecting with mental health professional seems just underwhelm if we compare to their needs. 

With some more discussing with some on my friends and colleagues, and with a more deep dive on researching, I find out that continuous stress is one of the biggest problem that leads to mental health disorder. So what if we integrate some kind of daily mental health exercises into our application. And it's tailored to have personal preferences since different people may have/need different way to deal with stress. Like listening to some music, watch some entertainment shows, read some novel, or even meditating. Imagine if we could help people exercises to have not only a better physical health, but also a better mental health as well. 

In the end, I come up with a mobile application which give you routinely exercises for your mental help based on your personal preferences and feedback. AI technology definitely would be helpful. The application would certainly have the simple, quick path to let people reach for professional help. And they can opt for an inperson meeting, or just through online chatting or video call which ever they prefer. There still much more possibility that it can achieves, onlne video sessions to raise awareness, sharing groups where people can share their stories, and much more.
