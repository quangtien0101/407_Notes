## Assignment 2: Observer into your daily life environmental or societal scenes, and figure out things that were *not-right* under your eyes

For my this assignment, my initial observation was about why does nearly everyone I known has *burnout* syndrome and no one seems to willing to take care of this issue. But to make sure that my observation is indeed based on facts, I need to know more about the syndrome itself.

>Burnout has been defined as a job-included syndrome combining emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment
>---(Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001)---

With a clear definition about the syndrome, I started to having conversations with 10 different people whom are my colleagues, close friend, relatives. And 7/10 of them admittedly to have from 2 to 3 components of the syndrome while the rest told me that they currently either have only one component. But there is still some discussions on how to determine whether or not a person is having burnout based on these three components *(Bianchi, Schonfeld, & Laurent, 2017)* , and for that reason, I would change the scope to people with metal illness as it much more easy to identify but I would still use burnout as a smaller subset of mental health.

It is a very fascinating case is that while 4/10 reckon themselves to be fully aware of their *not-right* mental state, they are were not taking any steps to get some professional help but rather, they accepted their states and consider it to be an  *inevitable thing* in their life. 
And 2/10 admitted that they realized that they have anxiety, emotional exhaustion and have been under stress for a long time but they don't know what to do beside get some medicine from the pharmaceuticals, they were confused and thus make their state even worse. This could be easily understand since when us - human - were young, nobody prepare us for anything like this, we weren't get to known how to deal with stress, anxiety or who should we talk to. etc.       
For the rest, they were in a mixed zone between the 2 group above, while recon that they have something *not-right* in terms of  their metal health mostly comes from their work life, they didn't try to talk with anyone about it since from their perspective, they afraid to be considered different, so they keep working despite they desperately need a rest. So when I gave them a scenario in which they have a vacation with zero impact to their work/wages, some would take it while some do not. And a interesting answer that I got was 
>"I don't want to be seen as not giving my best so the idea of going on a vacation while everyone is still at work would be a NO" 

Now I can make an educated assumption on the status-quo that I'm observing:
- People don't talk about burnout or mental health issue in general
- People scare to admit their state, partly because their low self-esteem
- The lack of awareness cause not many people actually know about their status

With all that being layout, a very simple solution that I can give is to raise the awareness about mental health issues. This could be done so easily by integrate mental health to the education system. If we could teach children and teenagers about their physical health and body, why not doing the same thing for mental health and emotional issue.
But with a closer examination, I would think that if only we could show people that there is a better option. 
- A better option for people with low self-esteem to deal with the adversity encountered at work rather than have cost their own health issue to prove it.
- A better option that people can easily reach to talk about their states and get professional help. So easy that they won't have to think twice to do it  

As for the exact steps to make these solutions actually viable, it certainly would requires more time for analysis, research and networking with people with professional in the field.
